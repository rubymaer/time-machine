                    Inspired by the same reason I am submitting this project almost a month late, I have chosen Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) as my topic of interest. For the visual data, I have collected myself, I have taken photos every ten minutes of the sun setting. According to the Mayo Clinic
"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons — SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year. If you're like most people with SAD, your symptoms start in the fall and continue into the winter months, sapping your energy and making you feel moody. Less often, SAD causes depression in the spring or early summer."

                <br>
                <p>Symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Having low energy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Having problems with sleeping
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Feeling sluggish or agitated
                    </li>
                    <li>Having difficulty concentrating</li>
                    <li>Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty</li>
                    <li>Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>I chose to record the sunset because the relentless darkness late fall/early winter brings on is a significant trigger of seasonal affective disorder for me. For the interactivity aspect of this website, you can drag the sun icon to change the background colour to mimic a sun setting.</p>
